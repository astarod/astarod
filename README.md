- 👋 Hi, I’m @pajew-ski, also known as Michael Pajewski!
- 👀 I’m interested in networks, python and a little bit of javascript, css and html.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning things about automation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something great.
- 📫 You can contact me at mail@pajew.ski!

I've been using vim for about 2 years now, mostly because I can't figure out how to exit it.
